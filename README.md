## What is RottenJS ?
RottenJS is a light-weight(8kb), all-in-one Javascript library. It can be used for DOM manipulation and web development. RottenJS also comes with HTML rendering, device/os detection and other utilities that might come in handy. The library is recommended for personal projects as its very light and scale well with medium-sized websites, but not recommended for big websites that are in production. RottenJS is a perfect fit for you if you want to create projects quick and easy, or if you just want to mess around with open-source libraries.
